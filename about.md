# About

Welcome to The Herald’s Spring 2023 Poll. Between March 7 and 9, Herald staffers polled over 1,000 undergraduate students on a variety of questions, ranging from demographics and lifestyle to approval of campus leaders and policies. Some of our notable findings can be explored here, and you can further explore the data on your own using this interactive site.

<br>

The Herald conducts a campus-wide poll each semester to identify trends in student opinions and experiences. The results of our fall 2022 poll — which was conducted in collaboration with the [Brown Opinion Project](https://www.brownopinionproject.com/) — are available [here](https://projects.browndailyherald.com/2022/10/23/poll/).

<br>

Much of this data — from sleep habits to Naked Donut Run participation — cannot be found elsewhere and offers a data-driven perspective on who the Brown undergraduate community is and what they think. In the coming weeks, The Herald will publish a series of articles investigating individual poll results and crosstabs in greater depth.

<br>

Non-demographic questions in this poll have been weighted by class year based on [matriculation statistics](https://www.brown.edu/news/2022-09-02/2026-numbers#:~:text=A%20total%20of%2050%2C649%20students,a%20matriculating%20class%20of%201%2C719.) from the University.

## Methodology

The Herald’s spring 2023 poll was conducted over the course of three days from March 7 to March 9 across three locations on campus: the Main Green, Barus and Holley and outside the Sharpe Refectory. The poll only includes responses from undergraduate students. Poll responses were collected through Google Form responses. Responses to all questions were required. The Herald collected 1,020 complete responses to its poll. The Herald collected poll responses anonymously to preserve the privacy of all students who participated. Only select senior members of The Herald’s staff had access to the complete raw data for analysis to preserve this privacy.

<br>

The margin of error is 3.068% with 95% confidence. Data for non-demographic questions is weighted by class year to reflect the University’s undergraduate student body.
